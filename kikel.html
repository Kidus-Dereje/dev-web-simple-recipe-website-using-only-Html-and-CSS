            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <br>
            <p>¼ pot lamb meat, without the bones being removed
                <br>
                ¼ pot potatoes, largely chopped
                <br>
                1 pot full of cold water
                <br>
                3 cups onions, sliced
                <br>
                ½ cup green chili pepper, chopped
                <br>
                ½ cup cloves of garlic
                <br>
                2 tbsp turmeric
                <br>
                1 tbsp salt
                <br>
                2 tbsp oil
                <br>
                2 tbsp niter kibbeh (Ethiopian clarified butter)</p><br>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Start by filling a large-sized pot with cold water and placing it on your stove. Then add the lamb meat with bones along with the onions, garlic, turmeric, oil, and salt.
                Stir the mix gently and bring the pot to a boil for about 1 hr. and 30 min.
                Check and see if lamb meat has been cooked well enough and how tender it has gotten. Then add the potatoes and continue cooking for 10 to 20 minutes until the meat is cooked to your satisfaction.
                Lastly, add the green chili peppers and niter kibbeh and continue cooking for about 5 more minutes until the potatoes are also cooked to your satisfaction. You can now serve your Kikil hot in large-enough bowls.</p>

            <h2>About&nbsp;<ab>Kikel</ab></h2>
            <p>Kikil - Kikel is a mild stew type of dish.
                <br>
                This dish is made with Lamb and Potatoes.
                <br>
                It is slow cooked and whatever meat you use it should have some bones.
                <br>              
                It is like Alicha in many ways but Kikel is more of a thinner watery stew.</p>
