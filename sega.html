                <br>
                4 large red onions (peeled and coarsely chopped)

                1 tbsp canola or vegetable oil
                <br>
                1 tbsp niter kibbeh
                <br>
                ¼ cup + 2 tsp berbere spice
                <br>
                1 tsp salt (plus more, to taste)
                <br>
                ¾ cup hot water (plus more, if needed)
                <br>
                2 sprigs fresh thyme (optional)</p><br>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Heat 3 tablespoons of niter kibbeh or butter in a heavy pot or Dutch oven. Add the onions and cook, covered, over low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
                Add the garlic, ginger, and 1 tablespoon niter kibbeh and continue to cook for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
                Add the berbere and the 2 remaining tablespoons of niter kibbeh and cook, covered, over low heat for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
                Add the beef, broth, salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45-60 minutes, or until the beef is tender, stirring occasionally.
