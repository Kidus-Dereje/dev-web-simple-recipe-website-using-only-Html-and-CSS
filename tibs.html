            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <br>
            <p>5 tablespoons niter kibbeh, or plain unsalted butter
                <br>
                2 medium onions, chopped medium (about 2 cups)
                <br>
                3-inch knob ginger, minced, about 2 tablespoons
                <br>
                6 medium cloves garlic, minced, about 2 tablespoons
                <br>
                2 tablespoons berbere (see note)
                <br>
                Kosher salt
                <br>
                1 pound beef sirloin, cut into 1-inch cubes, trimmed of excess fat and connective tissue
                <br>
                1 teaspoon vegetable oil
                <br>
                1 teaspoon lemon juice, to taste</p><br>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Melt niter kibbeh or butter in a heavy saucepan on medium heat, then add onions, ginger, garlic, and berbere. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are dark, ruddy, and golden, about 30 minutes. Onions should be at a low sizzle during cooking process. Adjust heat accordingly. Transfer to food processor and blend until not quite a pur√©e. Return to saucepan, season to taste with salt, and keep warm.
                Season beef on all sides generously with kosher salt. Heat oil in a 12-inch cast iron or stainless steel skillet over high heat high until lightly smoking. Add beef in a single layer, leaving plenty of open space in the pan (brown in batches if you don't have a large enough skillet). Cook without moving until well-seared on one side, about 3 minutes. Flip meat cubes with tongs and cook on second side until well seared. Continue to cook meat, stirring and flipping occasionally until desired level of doneness is reached.</p>

            <h2>About&nbsp;<ab>Tibs</ab></h2>
            <p>The sauce in this dish gets its kick from berbere, an Ethiopian chile powder fragrant with cardamom, fenugreek, and clove. Use it once and you'll see why a good chunk of Ethiopian cuisine is built on it.This dish is super easy to make, but you do need a few unusual ingredients and spices, and you need to have everything set to go before you start cooking because it comes together very fast.</p>
