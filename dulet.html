            <p>Dulet can be eaten raw or cooked depending on your preference, but it is exclusively eaten using Injera, the sour bread pairing perfectly with the Berbere spiced meat. According to Serious Eats, dulet looks and feels like a plate of finely chopped meat that is savory in flavor and filling to eat. In addition, tripe has 18 grams of protein in every five ounces, liver is considered a superfood with all its vitamins and minerals, and beef has 26.1 grams of protein for every 3.5 ounces, making dulet nutrient and protein-rich (via Healthline). So if you decide to indulge in this Ethiopian delicacy, be prepared to tuck into a hearty meal.</p>

            <h2>About&nbsp;<ab>Dulet</ab></h2>
            <p>This one needs a strong stomach just like Tere siga. When you eat it, you might not notice but Dulet is made from minced animal tripe mixed with liver and other lean meats. It is then flavoured with cardamom, onions, peppers and other Ethiopian spices. It is basically reserved for the uninitiated so you might not find this in any restaurant.</p>
