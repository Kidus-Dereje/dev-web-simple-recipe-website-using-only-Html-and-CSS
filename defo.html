            <br>
            <p>Yeast Prep

                <br>
                95g warm water, approx 100-110F (1/3 cup + 1 Tbsp)
                13g sugar (1 Tbsp)
                7g Saf Gold instant yeast, regular instant yeast is fine too (2 tsp)
                <br>
                <br>
                Dry Ingredients
                <br>
                <br>
                600g all purpose flour (4 2/3 cups)
                11g salt (2 tsp)
                1 tsp ground cinnamon (1 1/2 tsp if milder ceylon cinnamon)
                1 tsp ground coriander
                1/4 tsp ground fenugreek
                1/4 tsp ground ginger
                <br>
                <br>
                Wet Ingredients
                <br>
                <br>
                250g milk, warm enough to dissolve the honey (1 cup + 1 Tbsp)
                140g honey (1/3 cup + 1 1/2 Tbsp)
                1 egg
                60g avocado or light olive oil or unsalted butter (1/4 cup)
                2-3 large pieces of banana leaves (or many lettuce leaves or parchment paper)</p><br>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Wash and dry your banana leaves.
                Line a 9" springform pan with the leaves, making sure you have excess for wrapping over the top of the dough. (See the photo gallery below)
                Lightly oil the leaves on all parts that will touch the dough.
                Gently scrape the dough out of your bowl and into the pan. With damp fingertips, press the dough to gently de-gas it and spread it evenly in the pan. Wrap the leaves over the top of the dough, not tightly on top but with no exposed dough.
                Let the dough rise again for 1-1.5 hours until the leaves/dough are cresting over the top edge of the pan.</p>

            <h2>About&nbsp;<ab>Defo Dabo&nbsp;</ab></h2>
            <p>Defo dabo is usually quite large and it is often baked for holidays and special occasions. It is made with a wide array of spices and seeds and this seems to depend on the preference of the baker. Recipes I looked at often included a subset of the following: nigella and cumin seeds, ground fenugreek, coriander, turmeric, and beso bela (a regional type of basil). Defo dabo usually has a small amount of sugar as well.</p>
